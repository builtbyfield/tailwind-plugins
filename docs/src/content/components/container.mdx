title: Container
description: This page provides detailed information about the .container class in Tailwind CSS. It explains how to use the .container class to create a contained layout, how to disable the default Tailwind container plugin, and how to use the .breakout class to allow full 100vw elements inside a container. It also covers the nesting of .container inside of .breakout, .breakout-reset and .container-reset.

## Description

By default all components render across the full width of the viewport. You can use the .container class to create a contained layout. The container class uses the values set in outerGutters and containerWidths in your tailwind.config.js to create a responsive container.

Note that the default Tailwind container plugin will need to be disabled.

Also includes a .breakout class to allow full 100vw elements inside a container.

.container makes a container that conforms to your theme.containerWidths taking into account your theme.outerGutters
.breakout breaks out of a .container, to make your element 100vw wide
.container-reset resets a .container
.breakout-reset resets a .breakout

## Container

This site has its content wrapped in `<div class="container">`. Youll see it is fluid with outer margins set to theouterGutters for each breakpoint. At then, when the window is wider than 1536px wide (theme.screens.2xl) the main column is a fixed width of 960px (theme.containerWidths.2xl) and centered within the window.

<figure class="container py-5 bg-yellow-500/40">`.container`</figure>

```html
<div class="container">...</div>
```

### Container nesting

<figure class="breakout bg-yellow-500/40">
  <div class="container py-5">`.container > .breakout > .container`</div>
</figure>

```html
<div class="container">
  <div class="breakout">
    <div class="container">...</div>
  </div>
</div>
```

Nesting of .container inside of .breakout, .breakout-reset and .container-reset should
all work as expected.

## Container Reset

Instead of wrapping all your pages in .container, perhaps you wrap each of your components, and then perhaps at some breakpoint you want go full bleed. In which case .container-reset will be useful. Here, at the lg breakpoint, a .container resets to full bleed:

```html
<div class="container lg:container-reset">...</div>
```
